## About Me

I am a third-year Bachelor's student in Artificial Intelligence, with a passion for data science, machine learning, deep learning, and reinforcement learning. I have experience in designing predictive models, image recognition, text analysis, and working with frameworks like Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, and Langchain.

I love solving problems using technology and am dedicated to sharing my knowledge by teaching data science concepts.
