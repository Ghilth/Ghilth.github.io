## About Me

I am a third-year Bachelor's student in Artificial Intelligence, with a passion for data science, machine learning, deep learning, and reinforcement learning. I have experience in designing predictive models, image recognition, text analysis, and working with frameworks like Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, and Langchain.

I love solving problems using technology and am dedicated to sharing my knowledge by teaching data science concepts. Currently, I am working as a Junior Data Scientist at Oasys Tech Hub, where I contribute to real-world data science projects.
